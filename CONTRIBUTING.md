## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/badas-open.git
cd badas-open

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style

We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for import sorting:

```bash
# Format code
black badas/
isort badas/

# Check style
flake8 badas/
mypy badas/
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add sliding window inference for long videos

- Implement chunked video processing
- Add overlap parameter for smooth predictions
- Optimize memory usage for edge devices

Fixes #123
```

### Documentation

- Use docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules
- Follow [NumPy style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) for docstrings
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add examples for new functionality

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_models.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=badas tests/
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Name test files with `test_` prefix
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions
